The expense of Orthodontics

At the age of twelve, my dentist had come to the conclusion that I was ready for braces. Yay!
Still, it hadn’t occurred to me the orthodontic care I would be receiving for the next three years would be one of the most expensive medical procedures in my life so far. 

An afternoon after that week, I stood in a chair, getting my very poorly aligned teeth, inspected by an orthodontist. X-rays and scans, and cost estimations were sent to my insurance company, and lets just say me and my mother had our fingers crossed for their approval. 

Orthodontia is the treatment of irregularities of the jaw or aligned teeth. Such treatments can be through different forms of braces, or Oral Surgery. People can get the unaligned teeth treated with traditional metal braces, ceramic braces, Lingual braces, or  Invisalign. According to Colgate, traditional metal braces can cost from $5,000 to $6,000, on average. This is a high cost that not all insurance companies are willing to cover. Therefore, it isn’t surprising when Orthodontic clinics like Charleston Orthodontics Specialists and White Brown Smiles state that one of the patients greatest cause of hesitation for Orthodontic treatment is cost. 

Taking both the ideas of Orthodontic treatment and Health Insurance into consideration, I have decided to focus on a project that would be able to inform people about insurance companies that could possibly cover orthodontic treatment for their children, and maybe even for themselves.This could be possible through the creation of a website, since we will be learning web design later this year in SEP. I could also include a section in the project in which the public could view different Orthodontic clinics, and the types of Insurance that they accept. Not only am I planning to make this project focused on Orthodontics and health Insurance, I am also attempting to see if is possible that the website I’m creating could be translated into different languages so that people from different backgrounds could benefit from the website. 

Ever since my orthodontic treatment started, I have developed a lot of curiosity for the field. This project will be a great start to expose me to information about this specific profession. It will also allow me to potentially help patients be able to receive orthodontic treatment that they need.
